<h1>Overview : Lab 13 Understanding Tickets Using Spiceworks</h1>

This repository documents my home lab focused on **Understanding Tickets Using Spiceworks** within a **VirtualBox** environment. The lab aims to explore how Spiceworks can be used to manage IT tickets, track service requests, and streamline support workflows. 

<h2>Objectives</h2>

- **Learn Spiceworks Ticketing System:** Set up and configure Spiceworks to create, manage, and track IT support tickets.
- **Ticket Management:** Understand how to categorize, prioritize, and assign tickets to team members within a virtualized network environment.
- **Reporting and Analysis:** Learn how to generate reports on ticket resolution times, trends, and overall support performance.
- **VirtualBox Setup:** Use VirtualBox to create a test environment with Spiceworks and simulate various IT service scenarios for ticket management.



<h2>Documentation</h2>

In this lab, we will focus on Spiceworks ticketing services, which is free to use, and explore how Remote Support can assist users.

To begin, we will create an account for Spiceworks using an email. After the account creation, we will set up a domain, which will be the same domain we've been using in our previous labs, [SimoTech.com](http://simotech.com/). Once the account and domain are ready, we will launch the IT Cloud Helpdesk through the IT tools tab at the top of the Spiceworks interface.

From there, we will dive into the ticketing system to understand how it works and how we can use it for managing IT support requests.
